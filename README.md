# Machine Learning – Linear & Logistic Regression

This repository demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

The goal is to provide simple, well-documented examples of regression techniques, making it easy for beginners to understand how these models work in practice.

## 📊 Implemented Models

### 🔹 Linear Regression

* Dataset: **House Prices**
* Input feature: `sqft_living`
* Target: `price`
* Evaluation metrics:

  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  * R² Score
* Visualization: Scatter plot with regression line
* Example prediction: Predict house price for 2000 sqft

### 🔹 Logistic Regression

* Dataset: **Credit Data**
* Features: `income`, `age`, `loan`
* Target: `default` (binary classification)
* Evaluation metrics:

  * Confusion Matrix
  * Accuracy Score
